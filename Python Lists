# Python Lists – Explained Simply

A list in Python is used to store multiple values in a single variable.

** Why do we need lists?
Suppose we want to store marks of 5 students.
Without a list, we need 5 different variables.
With a list, we can store everything together.

## Example
```python
marks = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]
Here:
marks is the list
Values are stored inside square brackets [ ]
Values are separated by commas

Accessing elements
marks[0]  # 85
marks[1]  # 90

Modifying elements
marks[2] = 80

**Why lists are useful

Easy to store data
Easy to access and update
Used everywhere in Python programs

## Conclusion
Lists help us manage multiple values efficiently and are one of the most important data structures in Python.
