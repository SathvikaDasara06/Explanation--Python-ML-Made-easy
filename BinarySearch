# Binary Search – Intuition and Example

Binary search is an efficient algorithm to find an element in a sorted array.

## Key condition
The array must be sorted.

## Intuition
Instead of checking each element one by one, binary search:
- Checks the middle element
- Eliminates half of the array each time

## Example
Array: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]

To find 8:
1. Middle element is 6 → 8 > 6 → go right
2. New middle is 10 → 8 < 10 → go left
3. Found 8

## Code

def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
