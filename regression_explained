# What is Regression? (Machine Learning)

Regression is a technique used to predict a continuous value.

## Simple Meaning
Regression answers questions like:
- What will be the house price?
- What will be the salary?
- What will be the temperature tomorrow?

## Real-life example
Suppose we want to predict salary based on years of experience.

| Experience (years) | Salary (LPA) |
|--------------------|--------------|
| 1                  | 3            |
| 2                  | 5            |
| 4                  | 8            |

Regression finds a relationship between experience and salary.

## Linear Regression
In linear regression, we assume the relationship is a straight line.

Equation:
y = mx + c

Where:
- x = input
- y = output
- m = slope
- c = intercept

## Why regression is important
- Used in prediction problems
- Used in finance, healthcare, and analytics
- One of the basics of Machine Learning

## Conclusion
Regression helps us understand relationships between variables and make predictions.
